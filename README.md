## Introduction
- These days, a substantial volume of data with high quality is required 
for improving the performance of image-related models. Through StableDiffusion models, we can generate images from text which are valuable.  
- In this research, weâ€™ll apply generated images to YOLOv5 model for 
Object-detection in order to check how useful these generated images 
are
